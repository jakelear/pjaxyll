# Pjaxyll

Runs on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)

Sped up by [pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax)

Deployed with rake/rsync

[Demo](http://pjaxyll.jakebot.com/2013/Pjaxyll-Demo)

## How it works:

[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) is a small static site generator written in ruby.

A [rakefile](https://github.com/jakelear/pjaxyll/blob/master/Rakefile) to build and deploy the site.
Rake also takes care of the following:
* Duplicate each post and replace the layout with a pjax specific layout.
* Add the post date of the YAML front matter of the PJAX version to retain the post date
* Compile the jekyll site


## Installation and Use:

### Getting the demo up and running:

To install, clone/fork this repo into an apache-served directory. If you
don't already have a directory set up to be served via apache, I recommend something like [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html)
to get you up and running quickly. Check out [this blog post by Trevor Davis](http://trevordavis.net/blog/use-htaccess-files-with-mamp) if you need to get .htaccess working in mamp.

MAMP runs by default on localhost:8888, and make sure to point it to the _site directory that is generated by Jekyll.

NOTE: Currently Pjaxyll is configured to work using .htaccess, meaning Apache is a requirement. The concept will work with any server that supports rewrite rules but you'll need to write your own.

Run
   
   `bundle install`
   
to install jekyll, rake, sass, and compass.

Run

    `rake build`
    
to generate the first site and you'll be able to visit your fast new demo blog.

### Customizing the config to fit your needs:

`_config.yml` is the Jekyll config. You should update the site name and url here. Also make note of the permalink format. Currently, the
htaccess RewriteRules are set up specifically for this format. If you need to change this format, you'll need to alter the RewriteRules in `.htaccess` to account for any changes.

In `Rakefile`, there is a task called "deploy" that uses rsync to copy the _site directory up. You can modify this with your ssh username and domain if you wish to use
the `rake deploy:live` task to publish your site.

###  Building the Site

You can use the demo posts in `_posts` as an example to write posts. Be sure to use the same format for the post filename. After writing a post,
or making other changes to the site (css, javascript, etc), Run

   `rake build`
   
which generates the site, and creates the pjax versions using the pjax layout.

### More info:

I wrote a 2 part post on how I set up my blog using this. You can check it out [here](http://jakebot.com/2013/jekyll-pjax-part-1/).
